    <string name="text">Deep in Siberia’s mines, let naught\n
    Subdue your proud and patient spirit.\n
    Your crushing toil and lofty thought\n
    Shall not be wasted — do not fear it.\n
    Misfortune’s sister, hope sublime,\n
    From sombre dungeon pain will banish;\n
    Joy will awake and sorrow vanish…\n
    ‘Twill come, the promised, longed-for time;\n
\n
    The heavy locks will burst — rejoice! —\n
    And love and friendship ‘thought delusion\n
    Will reach you in your grim seclusion\n
    As does my freedom-loving voice.\n
\n
    The prison walls will crash… Content,\n
    At door will freedom wait to meet you;\n
    Your brothers, hastening to greet you,\n
    To you the sword will glad present.\n
\n
    Alexandr Pushkin\n
